Welcome to the Blue Mountains Soaring Club. Founded in March 1987, the Club is committed to providing **safe and regular flying opportunities throughout the Blue Mountains and Central Tablelands** to the west of Sydney NSW for all of its members, from novice through advanced. Regular activities include Club competition days, novice days, towing days and heaps of social flying. We also hold occasional trips away to other well-known flying areas.

The BMSC welcomes all SAFA pilots to come and fly with us at sites in the region. Safe flying is our top priority. With prior contact, an experienced club pilot will be available to introduce you to our sites and give a detailed site briefing. We cater for pilots of all abilities, and invite all pilots who are keen and enthusiastic to come and explore the excitement of inland flying.

Feel free to [contact the Club]({{< ref "/contact" >}}) with any questions or queries that you may have, or become a member today!
