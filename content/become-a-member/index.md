Whether you're signing up to become a member for the first time or renewing your membership with Blue Mountains Soaring Club, just fill out and submit the form below.

**Note**: the form below currently requires for more information than should be required - we'll work on improving the form for the future but if you don't want to fill in those details while registering now, you can instead fill out our [manual PDF membership form](/docs/BMSC-Membership-Form-2022.pdf) and email it to the club address at [flybluemountains@gmail.com](mailto:flybluemountains@gmail.com). Or, if you're just renewing an existing membership, feel free to just transfer the membership fee to the account listed in the [PDF membership form](/docs/BMSC-Membership-Form-2022.pdf) (including your initial, surname, and SAFA number as reference) - and we'll sort out the rest. Thanks!
