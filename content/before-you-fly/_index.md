Mt Blackheath, due to its unpredictability and exposed mountain locations, is a dangerous **PG5/Advanced site** to fly from. Weather and flying conditions can change rapidly and without warning. We require visiting pilots to **obtain a site briefing each time you fly here**, until you have gained enough experience to fully understand site conditions.

Below you will find all you need to know about the Mt Blackheath west launch prior to arriving. Alternatively you can read about our other [lesser known sites west of the Blue Mountains](<<>>)
