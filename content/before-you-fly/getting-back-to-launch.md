The walking track back to launch is not clearly defined and even having done the walk back from the Landing Zone once or twice with others, **it can be easy to get lost** due to the numerous tracks that criss-cross the escarpment.

If you find yourself in the LZ without a car drop, the map below outlines the standard path, or if you use software navigation you can [grab the GPX file with the full path](/gpx/blackheath-lz-to-launch.gpx).

The following video may help you find the track and the pink flags with which someone has marked the track in the past (thanks to whoever that was).
