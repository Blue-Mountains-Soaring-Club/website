The Blue Mountains Soaring Club (BMSC) thanks you for your membership contribution. We also welcome your ideas and the giving of your time to club meetings and projects. Your club supports your access to sites but **needs your support in return**.
<!--more-->

The Blue Mountains Soaring Club is an affiliate member of the [Sports Aviation Federation of Australia (SAFA)](https://www.safa.asn.au/) and as such the **BMSC adopts the SAFA Code of Conduct**. You can [read the SAFA Code of Conduct on their website](https://members.safa.asn.au/isonic-downloaddoc.php?docid=0X0X1X1X47Wnkvb2IwaDFScW9iOU9nVi9Ody9sdz09).

As all NSW pilots are also members of the [New South Wales Hang gliding and Paragliding Association (NSWHPA)](https://www.nswhpa.org/), we also remind you to acknowledge its [Member code of Behaviour](https://www.nswhpa.org/s/NSWHPA-Member-Code-of-Behaviour-2019.pdf).

All pilots using BMSC sites must be members of the Sports Aviation Federation of Australia (SAFA) and undertake to **follow regulations as set out in the SAFA Operations Manual**.

It is a requirement of BMSC membership and use of Club administered flying sites that you agree to observe and abide by the following values set out below. Failure to abide by the 'Code of Conduct' could result in suspension of Flying Privileges or escalation to SAFA as deemed necessary at the time by the Committee.

## 1. Respect for Club sites

Flying sites are a precious resource for our sport and our club. Our custodianship of them and ongoing access to them is not guaranteed and is under regular scrutiny. The Mt Blackheath site is our main site, and over the years the club has worked hard to maintain a good relationship with Blue Mountains City Council, and the landing paddock landowner. There is no alternative landing site for Mt Blackheath so loss of this would result in the closure of the flying site.

Please ensure that you access and use flying sites in a manner that enhances our likelihood of keeping them. This includes:

- **Familiarity with site rules - this is your responsibility**. The rules are detailed on our website and site guides, and in some cases on site. If in doubt it is a requirement that you ask a representative of the club for clarity.
- **Launching, flying and landing only from or within specifically designated areas**, in appropriate conditions following approved site procedures.

You can read more specific examples in [taking care of our club sites]({{< ref "./taking-care-of-our-sites" >}}).

## 2. Respect for other stakeholders and site users

Please respect the rights and differing expectations of other site stakeholders - these include residents, landowners, members of the public and other site users. **Pilots must at all times show courtesy and respect in all dealings with the public**. You never know whom you may be speaking to.

Flying is not a right - itâ€™s a privilege and our ability to participate requires quality relationships with other stakeholders whose interest may not necessarily be aligned to ours. **Pay particular attention to
gates, fences, animals and vegetation**.

## 3. Respect for our sport

Know the rules, know your limitations, participate within them and make safety your primary consideration. **Every time you fly these sites you are representing your sport and your club**. Please portray an image we can all be proud of. Consider the safety and privacy of locals and other visitors.

This particularly applies to Mt Blackheath where large numbers of the public can be present at the launch area and its surrounds.

## 4. Respect for your club and your fellow members

In a sport like ours we may not always agree but we can control the manner of our disagreement. Please be considerate towards others. Represent the club in a positive manner and in line with the club's objectives and values. Respect and support your club executive and volunteers. Follow the advice of your clubs Safety Officers and/or Duty Pilots. **Conduct yourself in a respectful manner**, whether it is in-person or online (such as email, messaging or Social Media platforms).

All pilots have an **obligation to act in a safe manner and promote a "safety first" attitude when flying at our Club sites**. This includes helping each other (whether you are a Safety Officer/Duty Pilot, or not), promoting safety, flying within the rules, assisting in the event of an accident or incident.

## 5. Respect for our environment

**Please don't litter, whether biodegradable or not**. This means anywhere in or around our sites including car parks and lookouts. Whilst we can't always control other site users in this regard, we can lead by example by leaving the site clear of rubbish, taking responsibility and ownership for maintaining a clean environment, especially at Mt Blackheath.
