We have access to a beautiful site at Blackheath that **we need to look after** not only for ourselves but also the pilots of the future.

<!--more-->

Although our [Code of Conduct]({{< ref "./code-of-conduct" >}}) mentions the respect with which we -- club members and visiting pilots -- need to treat club sites, our club's past experience shows that **a few specific examples are worth highlighting**.

## Caring for the environment surrounding our launch sites

Specifically, please **do not trim or prune any bushes or trees around launch**.

Our Blackheath launch site is situated in a beautiful patch of council owned bushland. Over the years our club has worked hard to maintain a good relationship with the Blue Mountaints City Council as we manage the launch site. Our management of the site **does not include pruning or trimming of the surrounding bushes or trees**. If you see something that you think is a safety issue, please talk with any of the Club's committee members, or directly with a club member with environmental management experience, who can organise to have the issue addressed possibly with council involvement depending on the extent of the issue.

Of course, it's no problem to pull out the dandelion weeds and their lookalikes bordering the synthetic turf!
