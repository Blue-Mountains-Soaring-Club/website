* Update so "Contact" is in the main menu (more useful than About)
* How to have About available if not in the menu? Could link from Contact, but a bit odd, maybe good enough. Or link from Before you fly somewhere. Makes more sense. (E.g. The Blue Mountains Soaring Club has a [long history] ...).

* Get photos from Mount York that Julian found (on facebook?)
* Update contact to include FB messenger contact?
